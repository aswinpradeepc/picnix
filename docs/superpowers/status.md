# Picnix Project Status

Last updated: 2026-06-06

## Source Of Truth

- `design-context.md` is the project Bible. Product behavior, graph contracts, API choices, and fixed planning limits should be reflected there first.
- `pyproject.toml` is the dependency source of truth. Dependencies are added with `uv add <package>`, and `uv.lock` is committed.

## Planning Docs

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-31-bootstrap.md` — project scaffold, uv setup, `TripState`, settings.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-31-tool-layer.md` — Google Maps, Mapbox, and Gemini/Vertex tool wrappers.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-01-validated-suggestion-queue.md` — fixed raw candidate pool and validated suggestion queue.

## Design Specs

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-01-validated-suggestion-queue-design.md` — approved design for showing only N3-validated suggestions to users.

## Current Implemented Slice

- N1 intent collection with Gemini through `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` using Vertex AI ADC.
- N2 short-trip candidate discovery with Google Geocoding and Places Nearby Search.
- N3 destination validation with Places Details, opening-hours checks, markdown-backed known issue checks, and Routes travel-time checks.
- N4 route builder with round-trip Routes calls, first-class dynamic food availability decisions, destination dwell-time caps, and departure-time-based timeline construction.
- Streamlit partial demo for chat, current validated destination, accept, next validated suggestion, locked chosen destination, N4 route preview, and food availability decisions.

## Current Fixed Limits

- Raw candidate pool: 20 ranked Places candidates.
- Validated suggestion queue: 5 destinations.
- Nearby Search request size: 20 results per interest search before local dedupe/ranking.
- Departure time is collected as `constraints["departure_time"]`; N3/N4 must not hardcode a fixed trip start time.
- Known place restrictions and recurring issues live in `docs/known-place-issues.md`, not in node prompts or Python place-name lists.
- Food planning is route/destination-derived. N4 must not use static route towns, hubs, cities, or checkpoints for meal recommendations.

## Next Planned Work

- Planning change required before the next implementation session: swap the planned N5/N6 order in `design-context.md` and the implementation plan. The next slice should define the validation/claim-guard step before prose composition instead of composing first and validating afterward.
- After that planning update, implement the next node slice using the revised N5/N6 order.
- N7 final GeoJSON formatter and Mapbox/pydeck rendering.

## Latest Checkpoint

- `docs/superpowers/checkpoints/2026-06-06-dynamic-food-availability.md` — N4 dynamic food availability, route-derived food search, eat-at-destination/eat-at-home/carry-or-parcel decisions, and next planning change.
